description: NUMA toplogy with 2 sockets, 4 nodes

### Example NUMA topology with 2 sockets, 4 nodes:

A topology with 2 sockets and 4 nodes results
in this NUMA memory distance matrix:

|node| 0| 2| 1| 3|
|---:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|  0 |10|21|11|21|
|  2 |21|10|21|11|
|  1 |11|21|10|21|
|  3 |21|11|21|10|


The distance values in this diagram describes in a normalized way how large
the distance from a NUMA node's CPU to the memory of another node is:

- 10: This is (by convention) the distance to local memory of the NUMA node
- 11: Relative to 10, the distance to the remote memory on the same socket
- 21: Relative to 10, the distance to the remote memory on the other socket

This NUMA distance matrix could be visualized using this block diagram:
